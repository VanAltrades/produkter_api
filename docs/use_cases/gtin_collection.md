# Why GTINs

Google Product Ratings requires GTINs for your product to display reviews. [Product Rating Basics](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6059553?hl=en#:~:text=Without%20GTINs%2C%20Google%20may%20not,and%20relevant%20for%20customers'%20needs.)

"Without GTINs, Google may not be able to match all of your reviews to products. Learn more about unique product identifiers."

A GTIN helps us make your ad or unpaid listing easier for your customers to find. Products submitted without any unique product identifiers are difficult to classify and may not be eligible for all Shopping programs or features.
