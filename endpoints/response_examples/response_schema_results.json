I used it for my cousins bicycle.\r\nYou determine the size tube that you need by checking \r\nthe bicycle tire on the bike. You will find the width \r\nand diameter that is marked.\r\nWhat this product does is when the bicycle tire is punctured \r\nthe air escapes in the tire, then pressure forces Slimes \r\n FibroSeal small particles in the hole. This repairs the tire \r\npuncture. Also works for two years and is non toxic and\r\nnon flammable. Follow directions to install that are on the\r\nbox. It is fantastic! 5 stars!",

I've worked with local bike repair non-profits, and we've gone through a lot of tubes as we've worked on bike tires, and this is nicer and more sturdy than the ones I remember using. I think the valve is more appropriate for the newer bikes, and I'm glad that it will self-seal if we ever run over something that punctures the tire. Who knew that I would be excited to run over a nail and watch a tube do its work?!",

We tried blowing it up multiple times, but it just kept going flat! \r\n Installing the tube is pretty easy! You make sure the tire is deflated the whole way and then get the tire of the rim. Add a little bit of air to the new tube before inserting the valve and inserting the tube into the tire. Make the the tire goes onto the rim correctly and gently enough not to pinch the tube. Then inflate to the correct psi! Simple simple! Finally we were able to try out the new bikes- and had a blast!",
